## Description

Writing about tech can be just as important as making it. Developers spend plenty of time creating new applications and debugging existing codebases, but most developers also spend at least some of their time reading and writing about technical concepts, recent advancements, and new technologies. A simple Google search for any concept covered in this course returns thousands of think pieces and tutorials from developers of all skill levels!

This app simulates a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. This app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication. The site makes contains route api calls using the following HTTP methods:

      - GET
      - POST
      - UPDATE
      - DELETE

## Installation 

First you should clone this repo (https://github.com/grosario1/gr-Model-View-Controller-Challenge_TechBlog.git). You will need to ensure you install the npm utility and express.js framework in order for you run the app. You can follow the instructions to install the utility from here: https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm. Once, it is install, use the cmd to navigate to the repo you just cloned and run.... `node init -y` to initized the node js project, then install the packages/modules required to run the app by running `npm i`. You will also need to install the mysql2 framework in order to allow to code to connect to your mysql instance and database. Since you will need to connect to the database using a user name and password, it is recommended to store your credentials into a different file and call them from your code using variables. With this being said, in addtion to installing the other npm frameworks & modules, you should install `dotenv` which is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env. The module gets installed  as part of execution of the `npm i` command.

## Usage


- **Step #1:** Install MySQL into your local environment. You can follow the installation guide here: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/5.7/en/

- **Step #2:** Ensure you start the mysql server in your local environment. See guides: (https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/5.7/en/)

- **Step #3:** From directory where you cloned the repo, log into the mysql database, `mysql -uroot -p`

- **Step #4:** Ensure you source the database schema and seeds files.

e.g.

```
mysql> source db/schema.sql
Query OK, 3 rows affected (0.02 sec)

Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

Database changed
```
- **Step $5:** From directory where you cloned the repo, run `npm run seed` to seed the database with the data.

- **Step #6:** From directory where you cloned the repo, run `npm start` from the command line to start the npm app and the app will start listening in your localhost on port 3001.
